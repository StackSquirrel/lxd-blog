This is my first blog post on this new site, created in Jekyll. I have previously created static sites using Hugo, but this is my first attempt at Jekyll. The learning curve is pretty steep at the beginning, but I am starting to get the hang of it. Hooray! I'm hugely excited to slowly pull this site together.

Many thanks to the following open-source enthusiasts:
- [Learn:Static](https://learn-static.github.io/), a digital humanities project exploring static sites, especially with thier [Collection Builder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) tool, and to the [LibStatic](https://lib-static.github.io/) community.
- Evan Williamson's excellent tutorial the [Go Go GitHub Pages](https://evanwill.github.io/go-go-ghpages-b/content/1-intro.html) website.
- The helpful folks at [Jekyll Talk](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/).

Your assistance was very helpful and truly welcomed!
