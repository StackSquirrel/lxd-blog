This year is the 50th anniversary of *Dungeons and Dragons*, the (in)famous role-playing fantasy game, know to it's friends as *D and D*. 

A terror to the parents of the 1980s (satanic panic), today's anxious parents often welcome it ("at least they aren't on their screens"). Times have changed. D and D is now a cultural touchstone — something with which we all have at least nodding familiarity.  It is surprisingly pervasive in modern culture.

## Games as paradigms

About a month ago, I came across [Dungeons &amp; Dragons taught me how to write alt text](https://ericwbailey.website/published/dungeons-and-dragons-taught-me-how-to-write-alt-text/)", an article that clearly explains how to create this important accessibility tool. For my learners, the context element is a genuine struggle. They prefer detail to action. 

An example, you say?

![Book cover: The Devil threatens and old man and his much younger daughter.]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Bowen-Marjorie-Man-with-the-scales.jpg){:height="100px"} Courtesy: Toronto Public Library
 

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to describe the illustrated book cover of Marjorie Bowen's posthumous children's novel [The man with the scales](https://digitalarchive.tpl.ca/objects/379170) (1954), pictured above. 

Take a moment now to think about how you would describe it.

Ready?

Here is what the learner wrote.

>A man in a green tailcoat, holding a brown and blue garment,  can be seen from the back, his right arm is raised. An older man in a brown tailcoat sits in a brown chair at a round ornate table resting his head on his hands. A woman with a royal blue, scoop-necked dress stands behind the older man. The draperies are pink and there are cream coloured columns and frescoes on the wall. (74 words, 383 characters)

Very thorough. It must be good, right? _Welllllll_... 

1. It's too long (100-150 characters is recommended). 
2. Is all that colour really essential, or is it just easy to describe? <br>Consider the audience: people who use screen readers. Many are blind; they don't really about colours. The rest can probably see the colours, so they don't need them.
3. Is it even relevant? <br>What is the purpose of the image? What is it trying to convey? (Hint: It's a book cover.)
4. Is it even useful? <br>Does it help the reader understand the image?
5. Is it even interesting? <br>Does it make me want to read the book?   
6. WIIFM? If I do sit through the description, am I any better informed? Where does it tell me the purpose of the image? (Hint: It's a book cover.)

Proposed revision:

> Book cover: The Devil threatens an elderly man and his much younger daughter. (13 words, 77 characters)

Bang! Short. Sweet. Right in middle of the action! Now, I know what the image is. (I also know what the book is about, an added bonus.). I must've rolled a 20! 

True, you do have to do some work. You have to know the context, and not be afraid to use it. That's why I think this article provides such a good explanation. Context is the key ingredient in the alt text pie.

## Games build interest

Actually, _D and D_ is having a bit of a moment, right now, judging by an article that was published in a recent edition of College and Research Libraries journal [Dungeons and Dragons in the Information Literacy Classroom: How We Taught Bias in a For-Credit IL Class](https://crl.acrl.org/index.php/crl/article/view/26468/34392)</a>". This was a semester-long class in information literacy.

**Geeky aside**: "Information literacy" — which is more interesting than it sounds — means recognising that you need information, searching for it, finding it, evaluating it, using it ethically, and citing it properly. It's essential to scholarship of any kind.

A decade ago, **Zombie Apocalypse** was all the rage. It all started way back in 2011, with a student library orientation comic, [The Library of the Living Dead](https://sphk200.sitehost.iu.edu/students/Library-of-the-Living-Dead-Online-Edition.pdf) (PDF). It spawned a conflagration of library programs across North America, like this [Zombie Attack program](https://programminglibrarian.org/programs/zombie-attack), published six years later.

Face it. Libraries are a hard sell to first-year students. Any hook will do, if it gets them in the door.

## Games and learning

Games also have a place in instructional design, if used with care. 

Games can help: 

* Build teamwork and collaboration 
* Motivate and interest learners
* Forge emotional connections with the material
* Immerse learners in the action: "learning by doing" can become a springboard into new topics
* Provide instant feedback and experiential learning, 
* Allow learners to explore and experiment in a safe environment
* Encourage critical thinking and problem solving
* <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/10/video-game-literacy/">Teach essential skills stealthily, while learners are pursing other goals</a> 
* Personalize learning
* Track progress and learning milestones
* Provide a sense of accomplishment and mastery
* Foster a sense of community and belonging
* Evaluate learning (sorting games, interactive quizzes, badges or leader boards, etc) 

Games can even make [boring things like, metadata creation, more fun](https://wikidata-game.toolforge.org/#), for some values of "fun". 

## Games or gamification?
A useful distinction here:

* **Gamification** means layering gaming principles onto a learning experience: missions, challenges, avatars, badges and points systems, etc. It can be done poorly. It can be done well.<br>Think "Periodic Table Jeopardy", or "Pride and Prejudice Family Feud". Think DuoLingo. 
* **Game-based learning** incorporates the learning into the game, which is designed specifically to achieve a learning aim. Principles and characteristics of the topic become part of the game. Importantly, the teaching is *game-like*, but reflects the *actual learning experience*. Imagine a game where school children take on various roles in their community, buying and selling things, making change to improve their math skills. Or a [sales game simulation](https://www.elucidat.com/showcase/#sales-simulation) that mirrors a real-world scenario. 

Incorporating some games into your lesson plans can help learning. It can be more fun. It can help learners "think outside the box". 

In fact, novelty builds new neural pathways, creating a richer web of associations with the material. [According to neuroscience](https://www.growthengineering.co.uk/the-neuroscience-of-gamification-in-online-learning/), a bit of game play can definitely improve a learning environment:

* It increases engagement, which in turn increases motivation and retention.
* It stimulates the hippocampus (which controls recall), and produces dopamine (which, in turn, creates positive associations with learning). 
* It can help learners focus on the task at hand, and reduce anxiety.
* Stories are easier for our brains to remember; a good collaborative narrative releases oxytocin (which increases trust and empathy). 
* It can help learners develop a growth mindset, which is essential for lifelong learning.
* Rewards stimulate serotonin, elevating mood, and playing increases endorphins, which reduce stress and anxiety, and just plain make us feel good. 
* It also helps prevent cognitive overload, and keeps our brains nimble and fit.

Doesn't that just sound like the best thing since sliced bread? 

There is a reason we do fire drills: they work. Pretending to evacuate the building cements the physical and mental models required to actually evacuate in case of fire. You panic. Your brain knows what to do.

## Potential pitfalls

Relying too much on games can cause potential problems, however. 

* If you rely too much on competition or badges (**extrinsic motivation**), you risk derailing the learning process. <br>Do you (or does someone you know) ever log into Duo Lingo less to learn the language than to not "break your streak"? 
* It can lead to superficial learning, where learners focus on the game mechanics rather than the content. <br>Think of the "Periodic Table Jeopardy" game: it's fun, but does it really teach you about the periodic table?
* It can create a false sense of achievement, where learners feel like they have mastered the material
* It can annoy the learner. While a game may make memorising more fun for some, games are a lot less enjoyable if you have no choice over whether to take part. **Always give them a choice**.

A more effective use of games is to scaffold productive challenges, or to document learner improvement (**intrinsic motivation**). And — like some spices — a little goes a long way.

## Also, games are fun!
Want to play a game, just for fun? I would invite you to visit one of my first loves is [Colossal Cave](https://grack.com/demos/adventure/), an adventure in spatial way-finding underground, based on a real cave system in Arizona. 

What's your favourite game?
