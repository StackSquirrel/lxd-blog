Learning Experience Design (LXD) is a design approach. The goal is to create effective and engaging learning experiences that meet the needs of both learners and their organization.

LXD combines principles from instructional design, user experience design, and educational psychology to create learning environments that are learner-centered and that promote deep understanding.

This site showcases some of my LXD projects.

As a settler on this sacred land, I would like to acknowledge that the places where I live, work and play are situated on Indigenous Land. The meeting place of Toronto has been a site of human activity for over 15,000 years, and is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island. This land is the territory of the Wendat and Petun First Nations, the Seneca, and the Mississauga of the Credit First Nation. In my thoughts and in my actions, I strive to honour the Dish with One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, an agreement between the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, the Confederacy of the Anishinaabek and allied nations to peaceably share and care for the resources around the Great Lakes.
