Learning Experience Design (LXD) is a design approach. The goal is to create effective and engaging learning experiences that meet the needs of both learners and their organization.

LXD combines principles from instructional design, user experience design, and educational psychology to create learning environments that are learner-centered and that promote deep understanding.

This site showcases some of my LXD projects.
